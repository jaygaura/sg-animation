## Flower Petal JS Animation original files

### files description

* `old.html` - animation works/looks as expected (except when I saved the page as HTML some petals get stuck)
* `new.html` - the page where we want the animation at.

### Expected behavior

* on "play" button click the animation starts
* on "pause" button click the animation stops and the screen clears

The `new.html` page does currently have an animation that sort of does the above. But it should be replaced with the animation from `old.html` (red rose petals).
